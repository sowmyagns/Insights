# Insights Iva

**Insights Iva** is a full-stack manufacturing ERP and business intelligence platform. It unifies production, inventory, procurement, sales, finance/accounting, HR, quality, maintenance, meetings (Google Calendar & Meet), alerts, documents, and analytics in a multi-tenant SaaS application.

**Tagline:** Business Intelligence • Analytics • AI

Security hardening (auth lockout, email verification, refresh tokens, RBAC, tenant isolation, headers) is documented in [SECURITY_REPORT.md](./SECURITY_REPORT.md). **Full security audit + hardening pass (16 Aug 2026)** — summary in [Security Audit & Hardening](#security-audit--hardening-aug-2026) below. **Frontend UI/UX audit (16 Aug 2026)** — [UI_UX_AUDIT_REPORT.md](./UI_UX_AUDIT_REPORT.md). Architecture and recent UI/live-data analysis: [PROJECT_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md](./PROJECT_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md).

**Latest stability pass (Aug 2026):** Full-stack audit — frontend build, Vitest, backend pytest, and sidebar→route mapping. **Security pass (16 Aug 2026):** Critical auth/RBAC/API fixes applied; core security tests pass. **HR module dashboards (Aug 2026):** mockup-aligned UI for HR Hub, Attendance, Leave, Payroll, Performance, Recruitment, Training, and HR Settings — see [HR & Employee Management](#hr--employee-management).

## Branding & Assets

| Item | Location | Usage |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Product name** | — | **Insights Iva** (browser title, sidebar, login, landing, i18n) |
| **Tagline** | `frontend/src/locales/en.json` → `nav.tagline` | Business Intelligence • Analytics • AI |
| **Logo** | `frontend/public/logo.png` | Favicon + UI branding |
| **Auth hero image** | `frontend/public/auth/slide-1.png` | Login/Register slider + landing hero background |
| **Brand component** | `frontend/src/components/common/BrandLogo.jsx` | Reusable logo with `sm` / `md` / `lg` / `xl` / `hero` sizes |

### Where the logo appears

- **Landing page** — navigation bar, hero section, footer
- **Login & Register** — header above the form title
- **Sidebar** — app header (logo only when collapsed)
- **Loading screen** — shown while the app bootstraps (`main.jsx`)
- **Browser tab** — favicon via `<link rel="icon" href="/logo.png">` in `index.html`

### Auth slider images

The sign-in / sign-up right panel (`AuthSlider.jsx`) rotates background slides:

| File | Slide | Fallback |
|------|-------|----------|
| `frontend/public/auth/slide-1.png` | Insights Iva (installed) | — |
| `frontend/public/auth/slide-2.png` | Analytics | Themed gradient if missing |
| `frontend/public/auth/slide-3.png` | Inventory | Themed gradient if missing |

### Replace the logo

1. Save your image as `frontend/public/logo.png` (PNG recommended; keep a wide aspect ratio).
2. Refresh the app — `BrandLogo` loads from `/logo.png` with no code changes.

**Note:** Demo tenant emails (`@smrt.local`) are sample data, not the product brand.

To add or replace slides, drop PNG/JPG files into `frontend/public/auth/` using the names above. See `frontend/public/auth/README.txt` for copy commands.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite
- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite, React Router, Axios, Tailwind CSS, React i18next

### Frontend performance

- **Route-level code splitting** – Each page is loaded on demand (`lazyPages.jsx` + `React.lazy`), so the initial JS bundle stays small (~77 KB gzip for the main entry vs. a single 500+ KB chunk before).
- **Localized Suspense** – While a chunk loads, a **light inline fallback** (`RouteFallback`) appears in the main area only; the sidebar/nav stay mounted so navigation doesn’t feel like a full reload.
- **Vendor chunking** – `vite.config.js` splits **recharts**, **react-vendor**, **i18n**, **axios**, and **export-libs** (xlsx/jspdf) so the browser can cache them and load them in parallel only when needed.
- **Dashboard** – Chart code lives in the `recharts` chunk and is fetched only when the user opens the dashboard.

### UI design system (colors & buttons)

Central tokens live in `frontend/src/index.css` (`:root`). Prefer CSS variables and shared button classes over page-specific hex.

| Role | Token / class | Typical use |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Primary | `--color-primary` / `ui-btn-primary` | Standard primary actions |
| Success | `--color-success` (`#036F71`) / `ui-btn-success` | Complete / produce / planning CTAs |
| Action teal | `--color-action-teal` (`#0F6D84`) | Selective purchase/payment CTAs |
| Action blue | `--color-action-blue` (`#7E93CC`) | Selective invoice create |
| Soft blue | `--color-primary-soft` (`#BBDEFC`) | Light secondary CTAs (e.g. Create Vendor) |
| Warning / CTA yellow | `--color-cta` / `ui-btn-cta` | Use **selectively** for warnings & attention—not every Create button |
| Danger | `--color-danger` / `ui-btn-danger` | Delete / destructive |

JS mirrors: `frontend/src/theme/colors.js`, `frontend/src/styles/theme.js`. Shared component: `ActionButton` (`frontend/src/components/common/ActionButton.jsx`).

**Global search** (navbar): `GlobalSearch` — nested input wrapper (icon does not jump when results open), clear control, Escape / click-outside.

#### Numeric typography

Figures (KPI values, money, quantity columns) use a dedicated font token so amounts such as `₹ 3,24,50,600` stay legible and column-aligned.

| Token / class | Applies to |
|---------------|------------|
| `--font-numeric` (IBM Plex Sans) | Digit-heavy text; falls back to Inter |
| `.ui-kpi__value` | KPI card values — weight 600, tabular lining figures |
| `.ui-num`, `.tabular-nums` | Table cells for money, quantity, codes |

#### Shared table robustness

`DataTable` and `Table` (`frontend/src/components/common/`) normalize their `data` prop with `asArray` (`frontend/src/utils/apiError.js`). A non-array API payload renders the empty state instead of throwing, so a single malformed response cannot blank out a list page. Page loaders should also pass list responses through `asArray` before `setState`.

`StatusBadge` maps unknown tones to a safe default; valid tones are `success`, `info`, `progress`, `pending`, `primary`, `warning`, `danger`, `error`, `neutral`.

## Features

### Production Management
- Production planning (orders, scheduling)
- MRP (material requirement planning) with links to production planning
- Work orders
- **Job Card** (`/production/job-card`) — shop-floor document view over live work orders (list + detail workflow); create via quick work order
- Batch tracking
- Machine status monitoring
- Daily production reports

### Inventory & Raw Material Management

Eight inventory screens share one layout language: page header with date + warehouse scope, KPI row, filter bar, then the main table or form.

| Page | Route | Contents |
|------|-------|----------|
| Store Dashboard | `/inventory/dashboard` | 7 KPIs, stock-status donut, recent movements, low stock, recent transfers, quick actions |
| Raw Materials | `/inventory/raw-materials` | 5 KPIs, search/filters, item table with stock status, View / Edit |
| Finished Goods | `/inventory/finished-goods` | Same pattern as Raw Materials, FG SKUs |
| Stock Transfer | `/inventory/stock-transfer` | 3-step form (Details → Items → Review) with summary panel, recent transfers |
| Stock Adjustment | `/inventory/stock-adjustment` | 2-step form, increase/decrease with live `Current ± Adj = New` preview |
| Stock Ledger | `/inventory/stock-ledger` | Date/item/warehouse/type filters, 5 KPIs, movement table, Excel export |
| Warehouses | `/inventory/warehouses` | 5 KPIs, primary tag, location, utilization bar, create/edit/deactivate |
| Inventory Settings | `/inventory/settings` | Tabbed sections: General, Stock Rules, Reorder, Warehouse, Adjustment, Transfer |

- **Create Item** (`/inventory/items/create?type=raw_material|finished_good`) — tabbed form (Basic Information, Units & Pricing, Tax & Accounting, Inventory Details, Additional Information) with image upload preview and a sticky footer (Item is Active, Cancel, Save & Create Item). Posts to `POST /inventory/items`; presentation-only fields (HSN/SAC, brand, GST, MRP, min/max stock) are stored as description metadata since the item model does not have columns for them.
- Sidebar label for `/inventory/dashboard` is **Store Dashboard**; the breadcrumb uses the same label.
- Low stock alerts; barcode scan/manual lookup; stock movements.
- Sidebar **Inventory** (`/inventory`) opens the products/items list UI (same component as Masters → Products, titled Inventory).

**Preview data:** when a tenant has no records yet, these pages render mockup rows so the layout is reviewable. As soon as the API returns rows, live data replaces the preview — no toggle or seed step is needed.

Inventory settings persist under the `inventory_settings` feature-settings key (`GET`/`PUT /biz/feature-settings/inventory_settings`); legacy keys are preserved when saving.

### Masters (Customers / Vendors / Products)
- **Customers** (`/sales/customers`) — list, create/edit modal, export; bulk import at `/sales/customers/bulk-import`
  - API validation on create/update: company name required (must include a letter), contact person optional with letter check, email format, 10-digit phone, uppercase GSTIN (15 chars)
- **Vendors** (`/procurement/vendors`) — list, create/edit modal, export; full form at `/procurement/vendors/create`; bulk import at `/procurement/vendors/bulk-import`
- **Products** (`/masters/products`) — list, create/edit modal; create form at `/masters/products/create`; bulk import at `/masters/products/bulk-import`
- Deep-link create for customers: `/sales/customers/create` → opens the create modal on the list page

### Purchases & Procurement
- **Purchases** sidebar: Purchase (`/purchases`), Payments Made, Debit Note, Purchase Order
- Purchase orders, material requests, goods receipt (GRN), supplier payments
- **Enterprise Vendor Master** (`/procurement/vendors`) on the existing `suppliers` table
  - Company, contact, GST, address (PIN auto-fill), bank & procurement terms
  - Auto vendor codes (`VEN-0001` style), soft delete
  - Detail route `/procurement/vendors/:id` (overview, purchase history, products, payments, documents, performance, audit)
  - **Bank verification:** Account Number + IFSC via lookup API; bank name/branch auto-fill
- Roles with vendor access/write: Admin, Purchase Manager, Procurement Manager, Store Manager (Production Manager may see write UI where permitted)

### HR & Employee Management

The HR sidebar is split into expandable sections (Attendance, Leave Management, Payroll, Performance, Recruitment, Training, Reports, HR Settings). Dashboard-style pages follow a shared layout: KPI cards, filters, Recharts widgets, data tables with `InventoryRowActionsMenu` (⋮), and a right-hand summary column where the mockup specifies it.

| Page | Route | Highlights |
|------|-------|------------|
| HR Dashboard | `/hr` | KPIs, attendance bar chart, department donut, birthdays, recent joins, leave requests, quick links |
| Attendance | `/hr/attendance` (+ daily, calendar, leave-summary, reports sub-routes) | KPIs, filters, donut summary, calendar, today’s overview, records table with S.No. |
| Leave Management | `/hr/leave` | KPIs, tabs, filters, requests table, status donut, leave balance bars, upcoming holidays |
| Payroll | `/hr/payroll` | KPIs, payroll runs table, recent payslips, summary donut, quick links, create payroll modal |
| Performance | `/hr/performance` | Trend chart, rating distribution, top performers, recent reviews, insights, upcoming reviews |
| Recruitment | `/hr/recruitment` | KPIs, funnel, job openings, recent applicants, source analytics donut |
| Training | `/hr/training` | KPIs, overview donut, completion trend, categories, ongoing/upcoming programs, certifications |
| HR Settings | `/hr/settings` | General settings form, system/security/privacy toggles, category sidebar |
| Employees, Shifts, Documents | `/hr/employees`, `/hr/shifts`, `/hr/documents` | Existing CRUD/list flows |

**Preview / merge pattern:** HR dashboard pages call live APIs (`hrApi.js`) when data exists. Empty or partial responses fall back to curated demo payloads in `frontend/src/data/hrMasterData.js` via `merge*Dashboard()` helpers (same approach as Quality Dashboard) — so layouts stay reviewable without seeding the database.

**Accounts fix (related):** Chart of Accounts (`/accounts/chart-of-accounts`) dedupes duplicate GL rows at the API and UI layer; list fetches retry transient connection resets during backend hot-reload (`chartOfAccountsSync.js`).

Core HR APIs remain under `/hr/` — employees, shifts, attendance (clock-in/out), leave, payroll, performance. Create flows: `/hr/employees/create`, `/hr/leave/create`, `/hr/payroll/create`, `/hr/performance/create`, etc.

### Sales & Billing Module
- Tax invoices, quotations, payment receipts, refund vouchers, proforma / export invoices, delivery challans, credit & debit notes
- e-Invoice and E-Waybill login helpers; digital signature page
- GST billing (SGST, CGST, IGST); payment tracking
- Customer management (Masters → Customers)

### Accounts & Reports
- Ledger, expense, expense settings, chart of accounts, manual journal entries
- Journal entries accept `ref`/`desc` or `reference`/`description` in the POST body; create returns **201 Created**
- Balance sheet, profit & loss, accounting reports, restore deleted documents
- Export to Excel / PDF where supported
- Legacy finance views (AP/AR/payment tracking/general ledger) remain routed under `/finance/*` where applicable

### Quality Control
- Quality inspection
- Defect tracking
- Batch quality reports
- Compliance logs

### Maintenance
- Machine maintenance
- Preventive maintenance
- Breakdown reports
- Maintenance schedule

### Analytics
- Production analytics
- Machine efficiency
- Inventory analytics
- Profit analysis

### Alerts & Notifications
- Low stock alerts
- Machine failure alerts
- Production delay alerts
- Maintenance reminders

### Notification Management (In-App Bell)
- Notification bell in the top navigation bar with live unread badge
- Per-user notifications stored in SQLite (`erp_notifications`)
- Types: Information, Success, Warning, Error, Production, Inventory, Quality, Maintenance, Sales, HR, Finance, System
- Priorities: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- Actions: open (auto mark-read), mark as read, mark all as read, delete, clear all (with confirmation)
- Optimistic UI updates — badge decrements instantly (e.g. 5 → 4 → 0) without page refresh
- Paginated notification list with infinite scroll in the dropdown
- Demo notifications seeded for each user on first backend start

### Meetings & Google Calendar

Google Calendar–style **Meetings** module with OAuth, event sync, and Google Meet link generation. Live data only — no fake calendar events or Meet URLs.

| Page | Route | Contents |
|------|-------|----------|
| Meetings Calendar | `/meetings` | Week view (Google Calendar UI), mini calendar, Create dropdown (Event / Task / Appointment schedule), calendar filters, list toggle |
| Meeting Details | `/meetings/:id` | Full details, Google Meet section, Join Meeting, Open in Google Calendar, Create Google Meet |

**User flow:** Connect Google Calendar (sidebar) → OAuth consent → Create event with optional **Create Google Meet** → Calendar event + Meet link stored in SQLite → participant invites via Google Calendar → edit/delete syncs back to Google.

**Security:** `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` and refresh tokens stay on the backend only. The React app never receives OAuth secrets or refresh tokens.

See [Meetings & Google Calendar Integration](#meetings--google-calendar-integration) for setup and API details.

### Multi-Language Support
- **Languages:** English, Hindi (हिन्दी), Tamil (தமிழ்), Telugu (తెలుగు)
- Language selector in top navigation bar
- Full UI translation (sidebar, pages, buttons, labels, messages)
- Selection persisted in localStorage across page refresh

## Meetings & Google Calendar Integration

Enterprise meetings with **Google OAuth**, **Calendar API** event sync, and **Google Meet** conference links. Tokens are stored server-side per user (`google_calendar_credentials`); meetings store linked event IDs and Meet URLs (`meetings` table).

### Architecture

```
React (MeetingsCalendarView) → meetingsApi.js → FastAPI (/meetings, /integrations/google/calendar)
  → meeting_service.py / google_calendar_service.py → Google Calendar API → SQLite
```

| Layer | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Models | `backend/app/models/meeting.py` — `Meeting`, `MeetingParticipant`, `GoogleCalendarCredential` |
| Schemas | `backend/app/schemas/meeting.py` |
| Services | `backend/app/services/meeting_service.py`, `google_calendar_service.py` |
| API | `backend/app/api/meetings.py` |
| Migration | `backend/alembic/versions/a1b2c3d4e5f6_add_meetings_google_calendar.py` |
| Frontend pages | `frontend/src/pages/meetings/MeetingsList.jsx`, `MeetingDetail.jsx` |
| Frontend components | `MeetingsCalendarView`, `CreateDropdown`, `MeetingFormModal`, `GoogleCalendarSetupPanel` |
| Frontend API | `frontend/src/api/meetingsApi.js` |
| RBAC module | `meetings` — Admin, Sales Manager, Production Manager, HR Manager, Accountant |

### Database

**`meetings`**

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `title`, `meeting_type`, `meeting_date`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `timezone` | Core scheduling |
| `organizer`, `location`, `agenda`, `description`, `reminder_minutes` | Metadata |
| `create_google_meet_requested` | Whether Meet was requested at creation |
| `status` | e.g. `scheduled`, `cancelled` |
| `google_calendar_event_id` | Google event ID (internal sync) |
| `google_calendar_event_url` | `htmlLink` for Open in Calendar |
| `google_meet_url` | Join URL (never hardcoded) |
| `google_conference_id` | Internal only; not shown in UI |
| `google_meet_status` | `available`, `pending`, `failed` |

**`meeting_participants`** — `meeting_id`, `email` (unique per meeting)

**`google_calendar_credentials`** — per `tenant_id` + `user_id`: encrypted-at-rest pattern via server-only storage of `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `token_expiry`, `google_account_email`

### Google Cloud setup (required once)

1. Open [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → create or select a project.
2. Enable **[Google Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com)**.
3. **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application**.
4. Add **Authorized redirect URI** (must match exactly):

   ```text
   http://localhost:8000/integrations/google/calendar/callback
   ```

   For production, use your backend URL, e.g. `https://api.yourdomain.com/integrations/google/calendar/callback`.

5. Copy **Client ID** and **Client secret** into `backend/.env` (see below).
6. If using **Google Workspace**, ensure OAuth consent screen is configured and test users are added while the app is in testing mode.

### Backend environment variables

Add to `backend/.env` (see also `backend/.env.example`):

```env
# Google Calendar + Google Meet
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/integrations/google/calendar/callback
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE=Asia/Kolkata
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth web client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth client secret (**never** expose to frontend) |
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` | Must match Google Console redirect URI |
| `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` | Default IANA timezone for new events |
| `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` | OAuth callback redirects here after connect |

**Python packages** (included in `requirements.txt`):

```text
google-auth
google-auth-oauthlib
google-api-python-client
```

Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Apply migration (optional if `create_all` already ran):

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

Restart the backend after changing `.env`.

### API endpoints

All meeting routes require JWT and the `meetings` module permission.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/meetings` | List meetings + Google connection status |
| `POST` | `/meetings` | Create meeting; syncs to Google Calendar when connected |
| `GET` | `/meetings/{id}` | Meeting details |
| `PUT` | `/meetings/{id}` | Update meeting + linked Google event |
| `DELETE` | `/meetings/{id}` | Delete meeting + cancel Google event |
| `POST` | `/meetings/{id}/google-meet` | Add Meet link to existing calendar event |

**Google integration**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/integrations/google/calendar/status` | Connected?, account email, configured?, redirect URI |
| `GET` | `/integrations/google/calendar/connect` | Returns `{ authorization_url }` for OAuth |
| `GET` | `/integrations/google/calendar/callback` | Google OAuth redirect (no JWT; uses signed `state`) |
| `DELETE` | `/integrations/google/calendar/disconnect` | Revoke local tokens for current user |

### OAuth flow

1. User clicks **Connect** on `/meetings` → `GET /integrations/google/calendar/connect` → browser redirects to Google.
2. User consents → Google redirects to backend callback with `code` + `state`.
3. Backend exchanges code for tokens, stores refresh token server-side, redirects to `{FRONTEND_BASE_URL}/meetings?google_connected=1`.
4. On failure: `?google_error=...` with a user-friendly message.

Development uses `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1` automatically when `ENVIRONMENT=development` (localhost HTTP).

### Create meeting with Google Meet

When Google Calendar is connected and **Create Google Meet** is checked:

1. Meeting row is saved locally.
2. Google Calendar event is created on the user's **primary** calendar (`conferenceDataVersion=1`, unique `requestId` per event).
3. Meet join URL and event `htmlLink` are stored on the meeting record.
4. Attendee emails receive calendar invitations (`sendUpdates=all`).
5. Duplicate participant emails are deduplicated before the API call.

If Google is not connected, the meeting is still saved locally with a warning toast — no fake Meet links.

### Frontend UI

- **Week view** — Google Calendar–style grid with color-coded events by meeting type, current-time indicator, S.No. in list mode.
- **Create dropdown** — Event, Task, Appointment schedule (same as Google Calendar Create menu).
- **Setup panel** — Shown when OAuth is not configured; lists exact redirect URI and `.env` keys.
- **Settings → Integrations** — Google Calendar & Meet status with link to `/meetings`.

### Try it

1. Complete [Google Cloud setup](#google-cloud-setup-required-once) and set `backend/.env`.
2. Restart backend: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
3. Log in as a user with `meetings` permission (Admin, HR Manager, etc.).
4. Open **Meetings** in the sidebar → **Connect** → sign in with Google.
5. **Create → Event** → fill title, date/time, participants → enable **Create Google Meet** → **Create Event**.
6. Confirm the event on the week grid, in Google Calendar, and **Join Meeting** on the detail page.

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Connect button disabled | Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `backend/.env`; restart backend |
| `redirect_uri_mismatch` | Redirect URI in Google Console must exactly match `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` |
| No refresh token | Revoke app at [Google Account permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) and connect again (`prompt=consent`) |
| Meet link pending/failed | Ensure Calendar API is enabled; retry **Create Google Meet** on meeting details |
| 503 on `/connect` | Install Google Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt` |

Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_meetings_api.py -q`

## Notification Management System

Enterprise in-app notifications for authenticated users. Each user sees only their own notifications (scoped by `tenant_id` + `user_id`).

### Architecture

```
React (NotificationBell) → notificationService.js → FastAPI Router → Service → Repository → SQLite
```

| Layer | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Model | `backend/app/models/erp_notification.py` |
| Repository | `backend/app/repositories/notification_repository.py` |
| Service | `backend/app/services/notification_management_service.py` |
| API | `backend/app/routers/notifications_api.py` |
| Seed | `backend/app/core/seed_notifications.py` |
| Frontend API | `frontend/src/api/notificationService.js` |
| Hook | `frontend/src/hooks/useNotifications.js` |
| Components | `frontend/src/components/notifications/` |

### Database (`erp_notifications`)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | integer | Primary key |
| `tenant_id` | integer | FK → tenants |
| `user_id` | integer | FK → users (recipient) |
| `title` | string | Notification title |
| `message` | text | Body text |
| `type` | string | information, success, warning, error, production, inventory, quality, maintenance, sales, hr, finance, system |
| `priority` | string | low, medium, high, critical |
| `module` | string | ERP module source |
| `action_url` | string | Optional deep-link (e.g. `/production/work-orders`) |
| `is_read` | boolean | Read status |
| `created_by` | string | Display name of creator |
| `created_at` | datetime | Auto-set |
| `updated_at` | datetime | Auto-set |

**Indexes:** `user_id`, `is_read`, `created_at`

### API Endpoints

All endpoints require JWT (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

Every response uses the standard envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "",
  "data": {},
  "errors": null,
  "timestamp": "2026-07-12T08:53:00+00:00"
}
```

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/notifications` | Paginated list (`page`, `page_size`) |
| `GET` | `/api/notifications/unread-count` | Unread count only |
| `PUT` | `/api/notifications/{id}/read` | Mark one notification as read |
| `PUT` | `/api/notifications/read-all` | Mark all unread as read |
| `DELETE` | `/api/notifications/{id}` | Delete one notification |
| `DELETE` | `/api/notifications/clear` | Delete all notifications for the current user |

**Business rules**
- Unread count is always derived from `is_read = false` rows for the logged-in user.
- Opening a notification automatically marks it as read (badge decrements immediately).
- Marking an already-read notification again does not change the count.
- Clear/delete operations affect only the current user's notifications.

### Frontend Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `NotificationBell` | Bell icon + badge in navbar; wires dropdown and actions |
| `NotificationBadge` | Unread count badge (caps at `9+`) |
| `NotificationDropdown` | Scrollable list, mark-all, clear-all, load-more |
| `NotificationItem` | Single row with type/priority styling, read vs unread |
| `ConfirmationDialog` | Reusable confirm modal (used for clear-all) |

### Try It

1. Start backend and frontend (see Setup below).
2. Register a tenant admin and log in with your own company email.
3. Click the bell icon in the top bar — demo notifications are created for local testing.
4. Open notifications one by one; the badge count drops instantly (5 → 4 → … → 0).
5. Use **Mark all read**, **Clear** (confirmation dialog), or per-item delete/mark-read actions.

## Settings API (Users, Roles, Permissions, Audit Logs)

Backend support for the **Settings** sidebar pages. Requires JWT and **Admin** role.

### Architecture

```
React (Settings pages) → /admin/* or /api/settings/* → SettingsService → rbac_service → SQLite
```

| Layer | File |
|-------|------|
| Service | `backend/app/services/settings_service.py` |
| RBAC logic | `backend/app/services/rbac_service.py` |
| Legacy router | `backend/app/api/admin.py` → `/admin/*` (flat JSON) |
| Enterprise router | `backend/app/routers/settings_api.py` → `/api/settings/*` (envelope) |

### Endpoints

**Users** (`/admin/users` or `/api/settings/users`)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/users` | List all users with roles |
| GET | `/users/stats` | Total, active, administrator counts |
| GET | `/users/{id}` | Single user |
| POST | `/users` | Create user |
| PUT | `/users/{id}` | Update user |
| DELETE | `/users/{id}` | Delete user |

**Roles** (`/admin/roles` or `/api/settings/roles`)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/roles` | List roles with permission summary & user count |
| GET | `/roles/{id}` | Single role |
| POST | `/roles` | Create role |
| PUT | `/roles/{id}` | Update role name, description, permissions |
| PUT | `/roles/{id}/permissions` | Update permissions only (`/admin` only) |
| DELETE | `/roles/{id}` | Delete role |

**Permissions** (`/admin/permissions/*` or `/api/settings/permissions/*`)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/permissions/modules` | Module catalogue for checkboxes |
| GET | `/permissions/matrix` | Default role → module matrix |
| GET | `/permissions` | All roles with permissions (`/api/settings` only) |
| PUT | `/permissions/{role_id}` | Update role permissions (`/api/settings` only) |

**Audit Logs** (`/admin/access-logs` or `/api/settings/audit-logs`)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/access-logs` | Activity list (flat array, legacy) |
| GET | `/audit-logs` | Paginated logs with `search`, `page`, `page_size` |

Login events are recorded automatically via `POST /auth/login`.

### User Accounts

The application uses registration and tenant-based user management. There are no default seeded users with production credentials.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+

## Setup

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env` (optional):

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./smrt.db
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Google Calendar + Meet (Meetings module) — see Meetings section
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/integrations/google/calendar/callback
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE=Asia/Kolkata
```

No extra database server is required. The SQLite file `backend/smrt.db` is created automatically on first backend start.

### DB Browser for SQLite

- **File location:** `backend/smrt.db` (relative to the backend folder when you run uvicorn from `backend/`)
- **Open the database:** Use [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to inspect tables and data
- **Important:** Stop the backend before opening the file in DB Browser — SQLite uses file locking while the app is running
- The first administrative user is created through `POST /auth/register`.

Run the backend:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs (title: **Insights Iva API**)

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create `frontend/.env`:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Run the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

App: http://localhost:5173 (title: **Insights Iva**)

### Docker (optional)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL | Notes |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Frontend | http://localhost:8080 | Nginx serves the built app + proxies API routes |
| Backend | http://localhost:8000 | SQLite persisted in Docker volume `smrt_data` |

The frontend image is built with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=""` so API calls use same-origin routing through nginx.

## Auth API (Login & Registration)

Base URL: `http://localhost:8000` (or your `VITE_API_BASE_URL`).

### POST `/auth/login`

**Request (JSON):**

| Field      | Type   | Required |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `email`   | string | Yes      |
| `password`| string | Yes      | Min **12** characters on register / reset |

**Response (200):** JWT pair + user (includes `refresh_token` when issued).

```json
{
  "access_token": "<jwt>",
  "refresh_token": "<opaque>",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "full_name": "Admin User",
    "tenant_id": 1,
    "tenant_name": "Company Name",
    "role": "Admin"
  }
}
```

**Errors:** `401` — `"Invalid Credentials"` (generic); `429` — account lockout.

### POST `/auth/register`

**Request (JSON):**

| Field           | Type   | Required | Notes        |
|----------------|--------|----------|--------------|
| `company_name` | string | Yes      | New tenant   |
| `full_name`    | string | Yes      |              |
| `email`        | string | Yes      | Valid email  |
| `password`     | string | Yes      | Min **12** chars |

**Response (200):** Same shape as login in development (auto-verified). In production, email verification may be required before login — see [SECURITY_REPORT.md](./SECURITY_REPORT.md).

**Errors:** `409` — Email already registered.

### Frontend

- **Login** (`/login`): `POST /auth/login`, stores `smrt-token` / `smrt-refresh-token` / `smrt-user`. Axios refreshes on 401.
- **Register** (`/register`): `POST /auth/register`.
- **Forgot / reset / verify:** `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/verify-email`.

Optional `backend/.env` (security-related — copy from `backend/.env.example`; full list in [SECURITY_REPORT.md](./SECURITY_REPORT.md)):

```env
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-long-random-secret-min-32-chars
ENVIRONMENT=development
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me-strong-password
```

Never commit real `.env` files or use example placeholder passwords in production.

## Usage

1. **Login:** API login with your registered company email and password.
2. **Language:** Click the Language button (🌐) in the top bar to switch between English, Hindi, Tamil, or Telugu.
3. **Notifications:** Click the bell icon (🔔) in the top bar to view in-app notifications. Unread items are highlighted; opening one marks it read and updates the badge without refreshing the page.
4. **Dashboard:** View production, inventory, HR, and machine status summaries. Use the top **search** bar to jump to pages.
5. **Production:** Create production orders, work orders, machines; open **Job Card** for shop-floor workflow views; track batches and daily reports. Tables support search, sorting, pagination.
6. **Inventory / Materials:** Store Dashboard, raw materials, finished goods, stock transfer, adjustment, ledger, warehouses, and inventory settings. Create stock items with **Add Raw Material** / **Add Finished Good** on the list pages (or **Add Item** from the dashboard quick actions); products are also available under Masters → Products.
7. **Masters:** Customers, Vendors, Products — create/edit via modals; bulk import pages for each.
8. **Purchases / Procurement:** Purchases, payments made, debit notes, Vendor Master, purchase orders, material requests, GRN, supplier payments.
9. **Sales:** Invoices, quotations, payment receipts, and related sales documents.
10. **HR:** Dashboard, attendance, leave, payroll, performance, recruitment, training, employees, shifts; HR Settings at `/hr/settings`.
11. **Accounts:** Ledger, expenses, chart of accounts, journals, P&L, balance sheet, reports.
12. **Meetings:** Open `/meetings` → connect Google Calendar → create events with optional Google Meet → join from detail page or week grid.
13. **Settings:** Theme, language, company profile, invoice/format/template/sector/sequence settings where enabled; **Integrations** shows Google Calendar status.

## Stability Audit & Validation (Aug 2026)

End-to-end audit across frontend routes, sidebar navigation, API integration, RBAC, and automated tests. Subsequent **HR UI pass (15 Aug 2026)** added mockup-aligned dashboards without changing database schema.

### Verification summary

| Check | Command / scope | Result |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Frontend production build | `npm run build` | Pass (incl. HR dashboard pages) |
| Frontend unit tests | `npm test` (Vitest, 28 tests) | Pass |
| Backend API tests | `pytest` (86 tests) | Pass |
| Sidebar → route mapping | 96+ sidebar links vs `AppRoutes` | **0 unmatched** (incl. `/hr/settings`, recruitment, training) |
| Backend route registration | `app.main` import | ~650 routes |

### Navigation coverage

All sidebar entries in `frontend/src/config/sidebarNav.js` resolve to registered routes, including:

- **Masters** — Customers, Vendors, Products
- **Inventory** — Store Dashboard, Raw Materials, Finished Goods, Transfer, Adjustment, Ledger, Warehouses, Settings (`/inventory` → products list UI)
- **Production** — Planning, MRP, Work Orders, Job Card, Schedule, Machine Allocation, Daily Reports
- **Purchases & Sales** — Purchase flows, invoices, quotations, e-Invoice, E-Waybill login, digital signature
- **HR** — Hub, Attendance, Leave, Payroll, Performance, Recruitment, Training, Reports, Settings (`/hr/settings`); candidates/interviews and training sessions remain placeholders on sub-routes
- **Meetings** — `/meetings` (Google Calendar week view + list), `/meetings/:id` (details, Join Meet, Open Calendar)

Legacy redirects remain (e.g. `/inventory/items` → `/inventory/raw-materials`, `/settings/expense-settings` → `/accounts/expenses/settings`).

### Backend fixes applied

| Area | File | Change |
|------|------|--------|
| Customer validation | `backend/app/schemas/sales.py` | Name, contact, email, 10-digit phone, GSTIN validators on create/update |
| Journal entries | `backend/app/schemas/accounts.py` | Map `reference`/`description` → `ref`/`desc` before persist |
| RBAC permissions | `backend/app/core/permissions.py` | Roles with explicit `permissions` JSON use only those values; empty list falls back to `PERMISSION_MATRIX` |
| Chart of Accounts | `backend/app/api/accounts.py`, `frontend/src/api/chartOfAccountsSync.js` | Dedupe duplicate GL account codes per tenant; transient retry on list fetch |
| HR RBAC menu | `backend/app/core/rbac_constants.py`, `frontend/src/config/sidebarNav.js` | Expanded HR sidebar sections aligned with new dashboard routes |

### Global refresh UX

The bottom-right **Refresh** control (`GlobalRefreshButton`) re-fetches registered page loaders via `usePageRefresh` — no full browser reload. While refreshing: spinner, disabled button, cache-bust on GETs; on success: brief “Updated just now” message.

### Run tests locally

```bash
# Backend (from backend/ with venv active)
python -m pytest -q

# Frontend (from frontend/)
npm test
npm run build
```

### HR dashboard pass (15 Aug 2026)

| Page | Key files |
|------|-----------|
| HR Hub | `frontend/src/pages/hr/HRDashboard.jsx`, `hrMasterData.js` (`mergeHrHub`) |
| Attendance | `frontend/src/pages/hr/Attendance.jsx`, `mergeAttendanceDashboard()` |
| Leave | `frontend/src/pages/hr/Leave.jsx`, `mergeLeaveDashboard()` |
| Payroll | `frontend/src/pages/hr/Payroll.jsx`, `mergePayrollDashboard()` |
| Performance | `frontend/src/pages/hr/Performance.jsx`, `mergePerformanceDashboard()` |
| Recruitment | `frontend/src/pages/hr/Recruitment.jsx`, `DEMO_RECRUITMENT_DASHBOARD` |
| Training | `frontend/src/pages/hr/Training.jsx`, `DEMO_TRAINING_DASHBOARD` |
| HR Settings | `frontend/src/pages/hr/HRSettings.jsx` (client-side form; no persist API yet) |

Shared UX: purple accent (`#6366f1`), KPI cards, Recharts donuts/line/area charts, `SerialNumberCell`, row actions via `InventoryRowActionsMenu`, `usePageRefresh` on all dashboard pages.

### Known limitations (not bugs)

- **E-Invoice / E-Waybill / Digital Signature** — UI routes exist; live submission requires user-configured external portal credentials.
- **Settings → Alerts feedback link** — placeholder `href="#"` until a feedback URL or form is configured.
- **Vite bundle size** — `export-libs` chunk may exceed 900 kB; optional future code-splitting only.
- **HR demo fallbacks** — Dashboard pages show `hrMasterData.js` preview when APIs return empty; live data replaces preview automatically when records exist.
- **HR Settings** — UI-only; Save/Reset toasts do not persist to backend yet. Two-factor toggle is not enforced by auth.
- **Recruitment / Training sub-routes** — `/hr/recruitment/candidates`, `/hr/training/sessions`, and some Performance/Leave/Payroll secondary tabs are placeholders.

## Security Audit & Hardening (Aug 2026)

Authorized full-stack security review of Insights Iva (React + FastAPI + SQLite). Scope: authentication, RBAC/IDOR, API validation, CORS/headers, secrets, error handling, frontend session handling, print XSS, and PostgreSQL migration readiness. **No destructive testing.** Full findings: [SECURITY_REPORT.md](./SECURITY_REPORT.md).

### Security model (baseline)

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Authentication** | bcrypt passwords; JWT access (30 min) + refresh (7 days) with rotation/revocation; login lockout (5 attempts / 30 min); session inactivity timeout |
| **Authorization** | RBAC via `require_permission`, `require_admin`, `tenant_scope`; action-level checks (`require_action`) on accounts mutations |
| **Multi-tenant** | `tenant_id` scoping on services and queries — users cannot access another tenant’s records by ID alone |
| **API** | Pydantic validation; generic 500/DB errors (no stack traces); JWT required on business routes |
| **Headers** | `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, CSP, HSTS (production), `Referrer-Policy` |
| **CORS** | Explicit `CORS_ORIGINS`; localhost regex allowed **development only** |
| **Frontend** | `ProtectedRoute` + path RBAC (UX); session requires JWT + user profile; axios auto-refresh on 401 |

Backend authorization is **authoritative**. Frontend route checks improve UX only — never rely on them alone.

### Critical fixes applied (16 Aug 2026)

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Any authenticated user could clear/seed tenant data | `/api/system/*` — **Admin only** + **blocked in production** |
| Client auth bypass via forged `localStorage` user | Session requires `smrt-token`; 401 clears all auth keys |
| Tenant JWT overwrote platform `Authorization` | Axios skips tenant token on `/platform/*` routes |
| Finance writes used module-only RBAC | Accounts create/update/delete use `require_action` |
| Demo passwords reset every startup | Seed scripts skip password overwrite in production |
| Real credentials in `.env.example` | Replaced with placeholders |
| Platform login without rate limit | Rate limiting on `/platform/auth/login` |
| OpenAPI exposed in production | `/docs`, `/openapi.json`, `/redoc` disabled when `ENVIRONMENT=production` |
| XSS in print templates | HTML escaping on dynamic fields in dispatch challan + production print utils |

### Verification (16 Aug 2026)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `npm run build` | Pass |
| `test_auth.py`, `test_rbac.py`, `test_tenant_isolation.py`, `test_journal_entries_api.py` | Pass |
| Full backend pytest | Some pre-existing repository-layer failures (documented in SECURITY_REPORT) |

### Production deployment checklist

1. Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`
2. Set strong `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (min 32 chars — e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`)
3. Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your production frontend URL only (no wildcards)
4. Configure `SMTP_*` for email verification and password reset
5. Set `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` to the public frontend URL
6. Set unique `SUPER_ADMIN_*` credentials (never use `.env.example` placeholders)
7. Deploy behind HTTPS (reverse proxy); HSTS is set automatically in production
8. Keep `backend/smrt.db` out of version control; restrict filesystem permissions on the DB file

### Remaining security TODOs

| Priority | Item |
|----------|------|
| High | Extend `require_action` to DELETE/PUT on inventory, sales, HR, procurement, documents |
| High | Move JWT from `localStorage` to httpOnly Secure cookies |
| Medium | Encrypt Google OAuth / e-waybill credentials at rest (`field_crypto.py`) |
| Medium | Redis or edge rate limiting for multi-instance deployments |
| Medium | Replace or isolate `xlsx` export dependency (known npm advisories, no upstream fix) |
| Low | Wire HR Settings security toggles (2FA, session policy) to backend |
| Low | Alembic-only migrations before PostgreSQL cutover |

### PostgreSQL migration notes

SQLite-specific items to address before migration: `require_sqlite` in `config.py`, startup `ALTER TABLE` in `main.py`, boolean/JSON/datetime column types, and concurrent-write patterns. See [SECURITY_REPORT.md](./SECURITY_REPORT.md) for the full compatibility checklist.
